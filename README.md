This algorithm is an implementation of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The ACO algorithm simulates the behavior of ants in finding the shortest path to a food source. 

The ACO function takes in several parameters: 
- `fourmisNumber`: the number of ants to be used in the algorithm
- `Tho_0`: initial amount of pheromones for each edge in the pheromone matrix
- `alpha`: the parameter controlling the influence of the pheromone trail in the decision of the ant
- `beta`: the parameter controlling the influence of the distance between nodes in the decision of the ant
- `rho`: the evaporation coefficient for pheromone trail
- `Q`: a constant factor that determines the amount of pheromone deposited by ants on the path they have traveled
- `NCmax`: the maximum number of iterations for the algorithm to run
- `distances`: a matrix of the distances between all nodes in the TSP

The algorithm starts by initializing the pheromone matrix and creating arrays for the tabou (taboo) list and the path length (Lk). Then, the main loop for the algorithm starts and it iterates through NCmax times. In each iteration, the algorithm creates a tabou list for each ant and calculates the length of the path taken by each ant. The algorithm updates the pheromone matrix using the tabou lists and the path length of each ant. 

After the NCmax iterations are completed, the algorithm selects the tabou list with the shortest path length and returns it as the solution to the TSP.
