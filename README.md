# Ant-colony-optimization-for-travelling-salesman-problem-
Ant colony optimization function written in JavaScript that calculate the optimale routing for the travelling salesman problem 
This is an implementation of the ant colony optimization (ACO) used to solve the generalized traveling 
salesman problem (GTSP).
The function recive the distance matrix of all cutomers and return a list that present the order of visted cutomers and the total distance of the routing.
The Aco function alos have others atributes such as:
-Tho_0:Initialise the pheromones Matrix.
-alpha:Pheromones influence.
-beta:Visibilite influence.
-rho:Pheromone evaporation coefficient.
-Q:Visibilite influence.
-NCmax:maximal number of ant colony.
